# The three that show the context manager working, and the only set in here
# meant to be read against each other. A deliberately small window so the
# session overflows: the recordings then carry a real split, a whole turn
# evicted, and the prefix surviving — or not surviving — the eviction.
#
# 1024 and not 512: the tool definitions are 465 tokens of the prefix, so at 512
# the fixed part alone fills the window and no history is ever retained. The
# recordings were degenerate — two files showing an empty history bucket, read
# as a comparison of eviction policies — from the commit that added tools until
# this one.
#
# Same script, same window, same counter. The first two are one flag apart; the
# third is the same twenty prompts grouped into four tasks, which is a boundary
# apart rather than a flag apart. See `RECORD/2026-08-30.tasks-in-code.completed.md`.
