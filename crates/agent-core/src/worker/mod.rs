//! Where tools actually run, when that is not this process.
//!
//! Level 3 of the sandbox (`RECORD/2026-08-27.tools-and-sandbox.completed.md`), in
//! the shape `RECORD/2026-09-02.the-worker-and-the-seam.completed.md` settled: **all
//! tools inside the container, the context manager and the model client
//! outside**, and one enforcement point rather than two mechanisms wearing one
//! config file.
//!
//! The seam is [`Executor`], which has one method. [`crate::tools::Tools`]
//! implements it by running the call here; [`Worker`] implements it by writing
//! the call down a pipe to a `luu worker` on the other side — a plain child
//! process under [`Runtime::Direct`], and the container's only process under
//! everything else.
//!
//! What crosses the pipe is a [`WireSandbox`]: the **policy**, not the resolved
//! sandbox. A resolved sandbox is a set of canonical paths on a filesystem the
//! worker does not have, and the container's `/usr` is the image's.
//!
//! The tool *definitions* deliberately do not cross. They are the second half
//! of the cached prefix, byte-stable across processes on purpose, and a prefix
//! assembled inside the image is a prefix that moves when the image is rebuilt.
