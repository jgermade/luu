//! The agent protocol: one message schema, several transports.
//!
//! These types are carried unchanged over stdio (the VSCode bridge), over a
//! WebSocket (the debug UI), and into the record format. Adding a field that
//! only one of them understands is how the schema stops being one schema.
//!
//! **Debug data does not live here.** Prompts, token budgets and anything else
//! that exists to explain the agent rather than drive it belong in
//! [`crate::trace`], on its own channel behind `--trace`, so a stdio consumer
//! never has to carry them.

/// Bumped when a change would break an older client. `Hello` carries it so a

/// **v1 was frozen** once every message in it had been watched being sent and
/// answered, the task lifecycle included, with the rule that a change an older
/// reader could not make sense of bumps this and [`crate::record::FORMAT`] with
/// it.
///
/// **2 is that rule being used**, for [`ServerMessage::Refused`]: an unknown
/// `type` in a tagged enum is a parse error rather than a line to skip, so a new
/// variant is exactly the change the rule names. See
/// `RECORD/2026-08-30.a-refusal-is-a-message.completed.md`.
///
/// **3 is the same rule again**, for [`ServerMessage::Evicted`]: what leaves the
/// window is a thing that happened to the conversation, not a debug reading, so
/// it is here rather than on the trace channel — and a client that could not
/// parse it would be watching a transcript whose turns are silently no longer
/// in the prompt. See `RECORD/2026-08-31.eviction-tombstones.completed.md`.
///
/// **4 uncrosses terminology**: the outer unit of work and approval is renamed to
/// **Job**, reserving **Task** for the fine-grained checklist items emitted by models.
///
/// **5 is the wire learning to say what it speaks**, which is federation's first
/// prerequisite: [`ClientMessage::Hello`] is a new client variant, and
/// [`Refusal`] gains `version` and `signature` — new values of a tagged enum,
/// which is the same rule as 2, 3 and 4. This is also the last bump an older
/// client learns about by failing to parse: from here a client says its version
/// and is refused out loud. See
/// `RECORD/2026-09-04.signed-approvals.completed.md`.
///
/// **6 was a session arriving from another host, and is not a version anything
/// speaks.** `imported` was built and removed the same day: a session belongs to
/// the host that made it, so there is no border for a message to describe. The
/// bump was un-made rather than left standing — a number whose whole job is to
/// tell two peers what they can parse must not carry a variant that no longer
/// exists. See `RECORD/2026-09-04.sessions-stay-home.completed.md`.
///
/// **6, taken this time: [`ServerMessage::Grounded`]**, which says what a turn
/// was asked with by reference, so that a resume can read it again instead of
/// losing it. Same rule as 2, 3 and 4 — a new variant of a tagged enum — and
/// the number is the one the paragraph above un-made, free for exactly the
/// reason `record::FORMAT` reused its own un-made 8: no peer ever spoke it, so
/// there is nobody to disagree with about what it meant. It is the first bump
/// since 5, which is where a client started saying its version and being
/// refused out loud rather than failing to parse — so this is also the first
/// one an older client learns about by being told. See
/// `RECORD/2026-09-19.fragments-by-reference.completed.md`.
///
/// **7 is the session becoming an alternation**, and it is the largest bump
/// here since 4 renamed the unit of work: `draft_opened`, `plan_proposed` and
/// `plan_declined` are three things a client has to see to draw the gate and
/// none of them existed, `job_approved` gains the draft it closed, and the gate
/// stops naming a job in either direction — `approve_plan` and `decline_plan`
/// address the one plan on the table, because a proposal is offered inside a
/// draft and an id is what approval hands out. `job_proposed` and
/// `job_rejected` stay parseable and are never written again: they describe a
/// job that under this shape is not one, and a recording that contains them is
/// a recording from before it. Same rule as 2, 3 and 4 for the new variants,
/// and the first bump that *retires* any. See
/// `RECORD/2026-09-20.every-turn-belongs-to-a-job.completed.md`.
///
/// **8 is the rung the alternation made common**: a draft closed because a plan
/// was approved out of it now says `approval` on `job_closed.by`, where it had
/// been indistinguishable from a person folding it. Not a new variant of a
/// message but a new **value** of one's field, which is the same break for a
/// reader — `ClosedBy` is a plain enum and an unknown value is a parse error,
/// exactly as an unknown `type` is. The first bump taken for a field rather
/// than for a line. See
