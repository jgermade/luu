//! The loop: prompt, model, tool, model, answer.
//!
//! ```text
//! prompt ─► model ─► text with a tool call in it?
//!                      │ no  → the turn's answer
//!                      │ yes → parse → check the policy → execute → append → model
//! ```
//!
//! [`run_turn`] is the model half and this is the loop around it, rather than
//! one function doing both: cancellation, streaming and the backend's stop
//! reasons are already right there, and a second implementation of them would
//! be a second set of bugs.
//!
//! Every step is a real message pair — `assistant(call)` then `user(result)` —
//! so the strict alternation the prompt shape depends on holds all the way
//! through, and the turn that gets stored can be replayed exactly.
//!
//! See `RECORD/2026-08-27.tools-and-sandbox.completed.md`.
