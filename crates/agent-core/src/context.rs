//! What earns its place in the prompt.
//!
//! Two commitments shape everything here, and both look like implementation
//! details from close up:
//!
//! - **Decide, then render.** The selection happens against a token budget and
//!   the rendering is a pure function of it, so every token sent can be
//!   attributed to a bucket. Rendering first and trimming the string afterwards
//!   loses that, and cuts wherever the limit happens to land.
//! - **The stable prefix stays byte-identical.** The system block is the part
//!   the prompt cache reuses. Nothing that changes per turn goes above it —
//!   selected code is fused into the *current* user message, as late as
//!   possible.
//!
//! See `RECORD/2026-08-27.context-manager.completed.md` for how both were arrived at.
