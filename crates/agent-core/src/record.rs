/// 2: the budget's `limit` became nullable and gained a `counter`, and the
/// header says what the run was measured against. A format-1 reader would
/// choke on `"limit": null`.
///
/// 3: the task lifecycle is on the protocol, so a recording carries
/// `task_proposed`, `task_approved`, `task_closed` and `task_reopened` lines. A
/// format-2 reader would choke on the first of them — an unknown `type` in a
/// tagged enum is a parse error, not a line to skip. Turns also gained the task
/// they belong to, and that half is backwards compatible: absent means none.
///
/// 4: `refused` lines, for the same reason as 3 — a new variant of a tagged
/// enum. `task_approved` also gained the plan as approved, and that half is
/// backwards compatible: absent means the proposal is the best answer there is.
///
/// 5: `evicted` lines — what the window dropped and never took back. Same rule
/// as 3 and 4, a new variant of a tagged enum. A format-4 file does not say what
/// its session forgot, and nothing can work it out afterwards: the floor lived
/// in memory. See `RECORD/2026-08-31.eviction-tombstones.completed.md`.
///
/// 6: `job_proposed`, `job_approved`, `job_closed`, `job_reopened`, `job_rejected`
/// lines, and plans carrying model tasks checklists. See
/// `RECORD/2026-09-04.from-tasks-to-jobs.completed.md`.
///
/// 7: `refused` lines can carry `version` and `signature` refusals, and
/// `job_approved` carries who approved. The first half is the same rule as 3,
/// 4 and 5 — a new value of a tagged enum — and the second is additive: absent
/// means the operator, because that is what every approval before it was. See
/// `RECORD/2026-09-04.signed-approvals.completed.md`.
///
/// 8 was `imported` lines, and is not a format anything writes: a session
/// belongs to the host that made it, so no stream ever arrives from elsewhere.
/// Un-made with the protocol bump beside it, for the same reason. See
/// `RECORD/2026-09-04.sessions-stay-home.completed.md`.
///
/// 8, taken this time: `pruned` trace lines, written by a run under
/// `--prune-behind`. Same rule as 3, 4 and 5 — a new variant of a tagged enum,
/// and an older reader chokes on it rather than skipping it. The number is the
/// one the paragraph above un-made, which is free precisely because nothing
/// ever wrote it: a format number says what a file may contain, and no file
/// contains `imported`. The protocol is untouched at 5, because what a prune
/// changes is the prompt and not the conversation. See
/// `RECORD/2026-09-08.prune-behind.completed.md`.
///
/// 10: the header names the **posture** a session ran under — the policy file
/// that decides its sandbox and its seam together. `luu.container.toml` opens by
/// saying that probes run under it are not comparable with probes run without
/// it, which is the same sentence `context_limit`, `counter` and `eviction` are
/// in the header for; a posture a session chooses and the recording does not
/// name is a corpus nobody can read back. `None` in every stream written before
/// it. See `RECORD/2026-09-08.a-session-picks-its-executor.completed.md`.
///
/// 9: `job_closed` carries what the fold replaced — which turns stopped being
/// sent, and what they were worth in the prompt they are no longer in. Additive
/// to an existing message, which is the rule 7 was taken under, and absent means
/// *not recorded* rather than zero. The protocol is untouched at 5: a client
/// that ignores the field lacks a panel, it does not misread a conversation. See
/// `RECORD/2026-09-08.what-a-fold-writes-down.completed.md`.
///
/// 11: the header names the three **resend rules** a run rendered its window
/// under — `repeat`, `prune` and `results`. They are in the header for the
/// reason `context_limit`, `counter`, `eviction` and `posture` are, and the two
/// builders that set them say it themselves: *"a recording made under it is not
/// the same arm as one made without it"*. Until this, the only thing on the
/// wire was the `pruned` trace line, which fires when rule B prunes something —
/// so a `--prune-behind` run that pruned nothing was indistinguishable from a
/// run without the flag, and a run under `--repeat-once` said nothing at all.
/// `None` in every stream written before it, for the same reason `eviction` is
/// `None` in one written before the policy was a choice: every one of those ran
/// under the defaults, but the file does not say so, and inventing the field on
/// the reader's behalf would put a claim in a record the record never made.
/// See `RECORD/2026-09-18.the-window-rules-are-a-session-fact.completed.md`.
///
/// 12: a `diverged` **trace** line, naming a path the prompt sent under more
/// than one body. `code_context` is written once when a turn closes and never
/// refreshed while every turn re-reads its own spans, so a file edited between
/// two turns goes out as two blocks under one `// path` header — and until this
/// line, nothing anywhere said so. A trace and not protocol, on the same
/// argument the `pruned` line is a trace: every turn is still asked, answered
/// and in the transcript, and what changed is the prompt. A stream written
/// before this simply has no such line, which is not the same claim as a stream
/// that has none because nothing diverged — the format number is what tells
/// those two apart. See `RECORD/2026-09-19.one-path-two-bodies.completed.md`.
///
/// 13: `grounded` lines, and the **protocol** moves with them to 6 — the first
/// time since format 3 that a bump is a protocol bump rather than a trace one.
/// A turn says what it was asked with, by reference: the specs, never the
/// bytes, because bytes in a store come back without being re-read and a
/// session resumed under a narrower posture would get back a file it is no
/// longer allowed to open. Same rule as 3, 4 and 5 — a new variant of a tagged
/// enum, and a format-12 reader chokes on it rather than skipping it. A stream
/// written before this says no turn was grounded, which is indistinguishable
/// from a session that grounded nothing; the format number is what tells the
/// two apart, and it is why a resume of an older stream still comes back
/// without code and is right to. See
/// `RECORD/2026-09-19.fragments-by-reference.completed.md`.
/// 14: a `repeated` **trace** line, naming what rule A kept out of a render.
/// Rule A became the default on 2026-09-19 and was the only one of the three
/// window rules that reported nothing — the number was computed inside the
/// render and subtracted from the `history` bucket, and a difference is not a
/// measurement of what made it, so a run that collapsed forty spans and one
/// that collapsed none left the same evidence. That is the complaint format 11
/// was bumped to fix one field along, where a `--prune-behind` run that pruned
/// nothing was indistinguishable from a run without the flag. Same rule as 3, 4
/// and 5 — a new variant of a tagged enum — and the protocol stays at 6,
/// because what a collapsed span changes is the prompt and not the
/// conversation. A stream written before this carries none, which is not the
/// same claim as a stream whose rule collapsed nothing; the format number is
/// what tells the two apart. See
/// `RECORD/2026-09-19.one-counting-surface.completed.md`.
/// 15: a `superseded` **trace** line, and with it rule A stops sending bytes it
/// knows are stale. Format 12 landed the detector and the record that argued
/// the repair deliberately did not take it, because the repair trades measured
/// prefix reuse for truthfulness and nothing had ever counted how often the
/// trade would fire. Format 14 and the corpus behind it produced the number —
/// **8 of 13 renders**, off two edits — and this is the decision that number
/// was waiting for: the newest body of a path wins and the older ones go out as
/// the line that cites them. Same rule as 3, 4 and 5 — a new variant of a
/// tagged enum — and the protocol stays at 6, because what a superseded span
/// changes is the prompt and not the conversation.
///
/// It is the one bump here that makes an *older* line mean something new: a
/// stream at 12, 13 or 14 carries `diverged` lines because the defect was
/// reported and not repaired, and a stream at 15 carries `superseded` where
/// those would have been. So `diverged` empty at 15 is *nothing was stale*
/// **or** *everything stale was replaced*, and the two are told apart by the
/// line beside it rather than by the absence of one. A run under
/// `--no-repeat-once` still reports `diverged` and never `superseded`, which is
/// what keeps the two arms one flag apart. See
/// `RECORD/2026-09-20.the-newest-body-wins.completed.md`.
/// 16: the session is an **alternation**, and the **protocol** moves with it to
/// 7 — the third time a bump here is a protocol bump rather than a trace one.
/// `draft_opened`, `plan_proposed` and `plan_declined` are new lines, and
/// `job_approved` gains the draft it closed. Same rule as 3, 4 and 5 — new
/// variants of a tagged enum, and a format-15 reader chokes on them rather than
/// skipping them.
///
/// It is the first bump that makes a line **stop being written**: `job_proposed`
/// and `job_rejected` still parse and a stream at 16 never contains one,
/// because the thing they describe — a plan that is a job in a state — does not
/// exist under the alternation. So a reader meeting one is reading a stream from
/// before this, which is the same service the format number does for `diverged`
/// at 15, and the reason neither line could simply be deleted.
///
/// A stream written before 16 has turns with no job. That is *written before
/// jobs were total* and not *asked inside a draft*: a resume gives them one
/// reconstructed draft that says so in its objective rather than folding them
/// into a job they were never asked inside — see
/// [`crate::context::RESTORED_DRAFT`]. See
/// `RECORD/2026-09-20.every-turn-belongs-to-a-job.completed.md`.
///
/// **17 carries `closed_by: "approval"`**, the third rung of a close, which a
/// format-16 reader chokes on for the reason every other bump here exists: a
/// plain enum's unknown value is a parse error and not a field to skip. It is
/// the first bump this file has taken for a **value** rather than for a line,
