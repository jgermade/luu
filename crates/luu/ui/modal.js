// @ts-check
/// The page's modals, as the element the platform already has.
///
/// Three of them — settings, the folder picker, the session starter — were a
/// `.modal-backdrop` div with a click handler and no keyboard at all. A
/// `<dialog>` opened with `showModal()` brings four things this page was
/// otherwise going to write by hand: **ESC**, a focus trap, everything behind
/// it made inert, and a `::backdrop` that is one pseudo-element rather than a
/// positioned div holding a `z-index`.
///
/// What `<dialog>` does *not* bring is the page's own state. Whether a modal is
/// on screen is `state.settingsOpen`, `workspace.picker.open` or `ui.starter`,
/// and a dialog the browser closed behind the page's back would leave a
/// component mounted, invisible, and holding the top layer with no way back to
/// it. So every native dismissal is routed to the same close function the close
/// button calls, and the component unmounts the way it always did.
///
/// See `RECORD/2026-09-16.the-modals-are-dialogs.completed.md`.

/// Opens the `<dialog>` with that id as a modal, once the template has put it
/// in the document.
///
/// Called straight from a component's `:setup`, which jq79 runs to completion
/// *before* the template renders — so the element does not exist yet, and this
/// waits for it. The same seam `content-viewer.html` uses for Monaco and for
/// `rows.js`, and for the same stated reason: the id is the one thing both
/// sides can name.
///
/// **It waits across frames rather than for one, and that is a fix rather than
/// a precaution.** It used to look once, on the next frame, and give up in
/// silence if the element was not there — which made opening the settings modal
/// a race against its own `:setup`: the call is followed by one `await import`
/// per section, and jq79 renders the template only after all of them resolve.
/// Two sections won the race. Adding a **third** — the one the modal's own
/// comment says its shape makes free — lost it, and the dialog stopped opening
/// at all, with nothing in the console, because a `<dialog>` that was never
/// shown is in the document and invisible. Found by a browser test clicking the
/// new section. See
/// `RECORD/2026-09-18.the-window-rules-are-a-session-fact.WIP.md` part 4.
///
/// `locked` is asked at dismissal time rather than read once. The folder picker
/// on a first visit is the case: there is nothing behind it to go back to, so
/// it refuses to close, and a dialog that let ESC through anyway would take the
/// page somewhere it cannot leave.
