// The transport layer, kept out of the components on purpose.
//
// Two reasons, both deliberate:
//
// 1. jq79 has no teardown hook yet (RECORD/2026-08-26.web-debug-client.completed.md), so
//    nothing a component owns can be closed when it unmounts. The socket lives
//    here, at module scope, where its lifetime is the page's. That is fine for
//    one page and will not survive per-session components — which is why the
//    hook is on the upstream list rather than crossed off it.
//
// 2. This is the half that will be type-checked. Once the protocol enums are
//    exported with `ts-rs`, this file gets `// @ts-check` against the generated
//    .d.ts; the templates stay untyped. Nothing here should need a DOM node.
