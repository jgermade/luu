//! The edit-and-re-read corpus's harness: proved without a model.
//!
//! `tool_call_probe.rs` proves a scorer, a corpus and the mock compose so that
//! running the corpus against a model later is the only new variable. This is
//! the same shape one neighbourhood along, for
//! [`scripts/tasks/edit-reread.txt`](../../../scripts/tasks/edit-reread.txt) —
//! thirteen turns that read four files, edit three of them and ask about two
//! of those again — and it runs the **real binary** against the **real
//! sandbox**, because `code_context` going stale is a property of a session
//! rather than of a reply.
//!
//! What it proves is that the corpus produces what it was built to produce:
//! **eight of the session's thirteen prompts** carry two bodies of
//! `src/greeting.rs`, off two edits, and **nothing at all** is said about the
//! three files that are there to stay quiet.
//!
//! Those eight are now the `--no-repeat-once` arm's, and the default's eight
//! are the same renders *repaired*: one body goes out and the stale ones are
//! the line that cites them. The two arms are read together on purpose — a
//! session with no divergences and no supersessions never edited a file it had
//! quoted, and telling that apart from a session where the fix did its job is
//! what the pair is for. See
//! `RECORD/2026-09-20.the-newest-body-wins.completed.md`. The two silences are the point
//! as much as the noise is — a corpus whose control also fires is a corpus that
//! measures nothing, and the two blind spots
//! [`one-path-two-bodies`](../../../RECORD/2026-09-19.one-path-two-bodies.completed.md)
//! §Still open names are only named there. Here they are reproducible.
//!
//! This is *not* a claim about a model. The edits are scripted, so the number
//! it reports is a fact about the corpus and not about how often a model edits
//! a file it has quoted. See
//! `RECORD/2026-09-19.a-corpus-that-edits.completed.md`.
