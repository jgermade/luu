//! anything else out loud — which is worth exactly as much as the two numbers
//! being right. They drifted the day `record::FORMAT` went to 8: the page kept
//! saying 7, the server refused every `hello` and closed, and the UI could not
//! open a session at all until a browser test went looking. Two constants in
//! two languages want a test that reads both, and this is it.
